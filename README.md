# Nasa Information Site
An app built whilst learning about various types of APIs. This project was completed alone to practice the new skills. It required the render to be dynamic enough to handle changes in the object key names. 

This app was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has attached TypeScript files to practice use of TypeScript.

Live version of the app available [here](https://annikachauhan.github.io/nasa-info/). Please be patient, sometimes the image takes some time to load. I chose the HD version of the image as they really are beautiful images.
